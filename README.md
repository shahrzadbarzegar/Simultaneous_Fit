This project presents research based on a method for indirectly measuring the Top Quark mass using a simultaneous fit. The data used was simulated using POWHEG and Pythia8 for the 2016 LHC experiments, considering six different Top Quark masses (166.5, 169.5, 171.5, 173.5, 175.5, and 178.5 GeV). The model employed for the fit is a combination of a Gaussian and a Gamma function. After determining the model parameters, the final fit was performed on the simulated data for a Top Quark mass of 172.5 GeV.
